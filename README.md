**Spring Batch**: spring-batch-billing-job (Spring Batch - Docker - PostgreSQL)

A batch application that generates billing reports for an imaginary cell phone company called Spring Cellular. The
application stores billing information in a relational database and generates a billing report. This application is
based on Spring Boot and uses Spring Batch's features to create a robust batch processing system that is restartable
and fault-tolerant.
